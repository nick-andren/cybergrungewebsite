# login stuff
i stole most of this from some random internet site and modified as needed. code is public domain as it takes literally 0 sweat of the brow to make and is pretty close to the minimum amount of code to implement the basic functions.

## notes
i need to figure out a way to make it so that before sessions expire, user is set to offline in the database so that user online status actually reflects who is online
